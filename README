== Acceptance

Copyright (c) 2008 James Coglan, released under the MIT license

Acceptance is a port of the Ojay.Forms validation API to work with the Prototype library. This
plugin provides hooks into your Rails application that can automatically generate client-side
validation code from your Rails models. Information on the client-side API can be found at
the Ojay project site:

  http://ojay.othermedia.org/articles/forms.html

The only difference here is that you need to call <tt>Acceptance()</tt> instead of <tt>Ojay.Forms()</tt>
when using the API. All the other function calls are identical. For example:

  Acceptance(function() { with(this) {
    form('the-form')
      .requires('username').toHaveLength({minimum: 6})
      .expects('email_confirmation').toConfirm('email');
  }});

Refer to the Ojay site for the rest of the API. You can use this plugin with the original Ojay
client-side library by putting this in your environment.rb:

  Acceptance.adapter = :ojay

To have Acceptance generate client-side code for you, simply replace any calls to +form_for+
with +acceptance_form_for+. A script tag will be added after the form containing rules for
any fields in the form that can be checked client-side without making a server request.

  # Before
  <% form_for(@user) do |f| %> ... <% end %>
  
  # After
  <% acceptance_form_for(@user) do |f| %> ... <% end %>

The following validation types are supported, with a few limitations:

  vaidates_acceptance_of
  vaidates_confirmation_of
  vaidates_exclusion_of
  vaidates_format_of
  vaidates_inclusion_of
  vaidates_length_of
  vaidates_numericality_of
  vaidates_presence_of
  vaidates_size
